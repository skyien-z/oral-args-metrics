    "John G. Roberts, Jr.": "Chief Justice Roberts is an institutionalist and a prudentialist whose legal philosophy consists of " \
          "judicial deference, separation of powers, federalism, and preserving U.S. sovereignty. Prudentialism is " \
          "committed to confining the judicial branch to a minor role in American democracy, while institutionalism " \
          "means that the Chief Justice seeks to rule on narrow grounds when possible to promote incremental change in law with an eye on the Court's legitimacy.",
    # https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/justice_thomas.pdf
    "Clarence Thomas": "Justice Thomas is a textualist who makes up part of the Court's conservative bloc. He takes a “liberal originalist” " \
        "approach to civil rights issues, particularly affirmative action, and a “conservative originalist” approach to civil " \
        "liberties issues, such as abortion. Liberal originalism embraces the broad principles of the Declaration of Independence, " \
        "such as the natural law ideal of equality; conservative originalism relies on the Framers' specific language and intent.",
    # https://houstonlawreview.org/article/129037.pdf
    "Ketanji Brown Jackson": "Justice Jackson is a former public defender who makes up part of the Court's liberal bloc. " \
        "While Jackson is comfortable using originalism as a means of constitutional " \
        "interpretation, she appears to focus on the preservation of individual rights and the needs of vulnerable individuals, " \
        "even if it places burdens on parties with institutional power.",

    # https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40649.pdf
    "Sonia Sotomayor": "Judge Sotomayor is part of the Court's liberal bloc. She tends to adhere to the plain meaning of the text but, in " \
        "the face of ambiguous language, appears willing to consider the intent and purpose of a statute. In her own words, " \
        "Sotomayor has a jurisprudence of process that emphasizes making decisions fairly. To observers, Sotomayor is known " \
        "for her adherence to stare decisis, meticulously evaluating the facts to inform whether past judicial precedents are " \
        "applicable. Like other on the Court, Sotomayor expresses a dislike for situations in which the court might be seen as overstepping its judicial role.",

    "Neil Gorsuch": "Justice Gorsuch is an originalist who makes up part of the Court's conservative bloc. He takes the primacy of legal texts " \
        "understood in their historical contextan d the proper role of the judge as interpreter but not law maker. He also ties due " \
        "process to the separation of powers and fair notice, with an emphasis on judicial independence and an aversion to judicial " \
        "balancing tests, the introduction of ambiguity into statutes by Congress, and judicial policymaking.",
    # https://www.gwlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/87-Geo.-Wash.-L.-Rev.-507.pdf
    "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.": "Justice Alito is a textualist and originalist who makes up part of the Court's conservative bloc. Three themes characterize" \
        "his jurisprudence: (1) a fact-oriented approach in which fact is distinct from doctrine; (2) an implementation of “inclusive " \
        "originalism,” under which a judge may evaluate precedent, policy, or practice, but only if the original meaning of the " \
        "constitutional text incorporates such modalities; and (3) a strong presumption in favor of precedent and historical practice.",
    # https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46562
    "Amy Coney Barrett": "Justice Barrett is a constitutional originalist and a member of the conservative bloc of the Court. She believes " \
        "(1) that “the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification”; and (2) that the “historical " \
        "meaning of the text” is legally significant and generally “authoritative.” Under this view, the “original public meaning” of " \
        "a constitutional provision is “the law.” Judge Barrett could be viewed as sometimes embracing a more pragmatic approach to textualism.",
    # https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45269
    "Brett M. Kavanaugh": "Justice Kavanaugh is an textualist and insitutitionalist . He believes in judicial restraint and relies on a law's text " \
        "to promote judicial neutrality. He is cautious of legislative history and any interpretive tools that rely on ambiguity as a trigger for application " \
        "and focuses on ordinary meaning and statutory context to resolve the interpretive questions.",
    # https://scholar.law.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=lawreview_forum
    "Elena Kagan": "Justice Kagan is a pragmatist and living constitutionalist who is part of the Court's liberal bloc, though her political beliefs" \
        "lean centrist. Pragmatism is a practical approach to the law that appreciates strict adherence to legal doctrine, but sees legal doctrine " \
        "as “less important than the practical consequences of a judicial decision.” A living constitutionalist believes you can take the words of the " \
        "Constitution and frame them in a way that incrementally responds to changes happening in society. "
