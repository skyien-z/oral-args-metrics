highlighted his belief “in judicial restraint, recognizing the primary policymaking role of the
legislative branch in our constitutional democracy.”Textualism. A foundational aspect of Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy is his embrace of
textualism, the doctrine that the words of a governing text are paramount to understanding the
meaning of a law.Beyond a reliance on a law’s text to promote judicial neutrality, Judge
Kavanaugh’s judicial opinions are frequently guided by what he refers to as “history and
tradition.”
others have observed that the nominee does not appear to “call himself an originalist, and his
opinions on the appellate court suggest that he uses less originalist analysis than Justice Thomas
or Justice Gorsuch.” enduring constitution and stare decisis

 The nominee has
argued on textualist grounds that judges should be cautious not only of legislative history, but of
any interpretive tools that rely on ambiguity as a trigger for application
Thus, Judge Kavanaugh’s opinion in Papagno relied on quintessential textualist tools like
ordinary meaning and statutory context to resolve the interpretive question. the absurdity doctrine “elephants
